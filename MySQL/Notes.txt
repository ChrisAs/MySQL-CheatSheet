SQL is boring

- How to install SID
  - Go to phpmyAdmin and click on a menu link called Import
  - choose sql file to import
  - make sure you have utf-8 selected
  - click go
  - there is some other shit you have to do, but I think I am missing a few steps
    so everything seems to be over my head for now

- Configuring MYSQL
  - the root password is yurizan8
  - to create a new password for the root user you to be in a command prompt
    under the path "C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.17\bin" and type in
    mysqladmin -u -root -p password. It will ask for you old password before allowing
    you to add in a new password.

- To change password in phpMyAdmin
  - go to path "C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.17\bin" and open config.inc.phpinfo
  - in the file where it has "$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']" change it to the
    new password


-Where to find the path to initialize mysql
  - Go to C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.17\bin
  - Then type mysql

- How to sign into SQL
  - Type: mysql -u <username> -p
  - The username is root, and the password is yurizan8

- SQL limit like an array
    - the limit command is just like an array where it starts from 0
    so if you have LIMIT 10 , will return 11 documents

	==================================================
	
	
	---- Querying -------------------------------------

    - SELECT <insert column name> FROM <insert table name>
      - displays all the values by the specific column name that you requested

    - SELECT <insert column name> FROM <insert table name> WHERE <insert conditions>
      - displays all the values based on the specific condition

    - SELECT * FROM <insert table name>
      - displays all the columns for the table name

   - SELECT * FROM <insert table name> WHERE (number NOT BETWEEN 1 and 20)
    -  This expression returns values where the property number does not have 1-20.
        The number property is a made up example, it can be data property that has numbers
        enabled like for example weight, or income. Whatever data property that is a
        number can use the NOT BETWEEN

    - SELECT * FROM <insert table name> WHERE  first_name LIKE "B%"
        - This expression searches for data rows where the property first name starts
        with a capital B. And returns all the rows that have that

    - SELECT * FROM  <insert table name> ORDER by <insert property name>
        -  this expression will order the rows of data based on the property name
        if the property is a number it will go from 0 - infinity. And if it is a
        string it will go from a-z.

    - SELECT * FROM  <insert table name> ORDER by <insert property name> DESC/ASC
        - This DESC or ASC determines how the rows will be sorted. By Default the
        rows will sorted in ASC = ascending form, but you can always put DESC = descending
        if you want to go from z-a or  100 - 0;

    - SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT startNumber, endNumber
        - Limits the number of documents that you receive from the query
        - You can have a start and end number or you can one number that will
        output then number of documents

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
	  
	-------- CRUD --------------------------------------------------------------  
    - INSERT INTO databaseTable (property1, property2) VALUES (value1, value2);
		- changes the values of a database table

    - UPDATE tablename SET  column = value
        -  updates a  value of property/column that you created
        - if you write this syntax alone it will update all documents that have
        that column in it so it would be best to specify which document you want
        to update specifically
		
	 - DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition
		- Deletes a row of data that meets a certain where condition
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	----- Remove --------------------------------------------------
	
	- TRUNCATE TABLE tablename
		- deletes all the content in the table
	
	- DROP DATABASE databasename
	
	- DROP TABLES tablename
	
	----- Create---------------------------------------------------
	
	- CREATE DATABASE databasename
      - creates a new database


    - CREATE TABLE tablename ();
      - this creates the table name
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	------- Display ----------------------------------------
    - SHOW DATABASES
      - shows the databases


    - SHOW TABLES
      - shows the rows of tables in the database

    - SHOW COLUMNS FROM tablename;
      - shows all the properties from the table

	- USE databasename
      - switches to the database that you want to use
      - USE databaseA, will take you to databaseA
	  
	- DESCRIBE tablename;
      -   similar to SHOW COLUMNS FROM tablename
	  
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	---- Modify -------------------------------------------

    - REPLACE INTO databaseTable
      - Updates a value is there was already  a value inside the propert, if there
      was no value set it will insert the value instead

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
	  
	----- Functions -----------------------------

    - SHA1()
      - encrypts a string that is 40 characters long


    - MD5()
      - is similar to the SHA1 function, but encrypts a string that is 32 characters long


    - NOW()
      - is a function that creates date, time, and timestamp columns
	  
	
	- SELECT CONCAT(prop1, prop2, prop3) AS alias FROM tablename

    - SELECT CONCAT_WS(separator ,prop1, prop2) FROM tablename
		- SELECT CONCAT_WS("* *", firstName, lastName) as fullName from person
		will display:  jermaine* *forbes
		- http://www.w3resource.com/mysql/string-functions/mysql-concat_ws-function.php

    - FORMAT()
		- SELECT FORMAT(decimal, digit) as money from bankaccount
		-  changes the decimal place of a  number
		- http://www.w3resource.com/mysql/string-functions/mysql-format-function.php

    - RAND()
		- My definition: This functions gives you a random number between 0 - 1. Similar
		to javascsript Math.random
		- http://www.w3resource.com/mysql/mathematical-functions/mysql-rand-function.php
		- SELECT cook_id , name FROM cookies ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 4;
			- Randomly selects 4 rows that will output the name and the cookie id;
